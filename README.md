Welcome to the Kate mod, This is where we will post updates to the mod, and it should be fun!
Windows updates will be slow, as I am a Linux user, (sorry Em', lol)

to make updates to the mod, make a branch, and make a push request, I'll accept, and it should go well! If there are any problems, mention in discord, and the issues board, as I am forgetful XD
